## Design Pattern

### Factory
"It acts exactly as it sounds: this is class that does as the real factory of object instances. In other words, assume that we know that there are factories that produce some kind of a product. We do not care how a factory makes this product, but we know that any factory has one universal way to ask for it".

### Strategy
"Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification".

### Adapter
"Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T".

### Observer
"A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use".

### Decorator
"Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions".
