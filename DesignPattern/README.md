## Design Pattern

### Factory
"It acts exactly as it sounds: this is class that does as the real factory of object instances. In other words, assume that we know that there are factories that produce some kind of a product. We do not care how a factory makes this product, but we know that any factory has one universal way to ask for it".

### Strategy
"The strategy pattern is based on algorithms. You encapsulate specific families of algorithms allowing the client class responsible for instantiating a particular algorithm to have no knowledge of the actual implementation".

### Adapter
"This pattern allows you to repurpose a class with a different interface, allowing it to be used by a system which uses different calling methods".

### Observer
"An object is made observable by adding a method that allows another object, the observer to get registered. If the observable object gets changed, it sends a message to the objects which are registered as observers".

### Decorator
"This pattern allows us to add new or additional behavior to an object during runtime, depending on the situation".
